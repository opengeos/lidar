## Introduction

**lidar** is a Python package for delineating the nested hierarchy of
surface depressions in digital elevation models (DEMs). In traditional
hydrological modeling, surface depressions in a DEM are commonly treated
as artifacts and thus filled and removed to create a depressionless DEM,
which can then be used to generate continuous stream networks. In
reality, however, surface depressions in DEMs are commonly a combination
of spurious and actual terrain features. Fine-resolution DEMs derived
from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can capture and represent
actual surface depressions, especially in glaciated and karst
landscapes. During the past decades, various algorithms have been
developed to identify and delineate surface depressions, such as
depression filling, depression breaching, hybrid breaching-filling, and
contour tree method. More recently, a level-set method based on graph
theory was proposed to delineate the nested hierarchy of surface
depressions. The **lidar** Python package implements the level-set
method and makes it possible for delineating the nested hierarchy of
surface depressions as well as elevated terrain features. It also
provides an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users
to run the program with minimal coding.

## Statement of Need

The **lidar** package is intended for scientists and researchers who
would like to integrate surface depressions into hydrological modeling.
It can also facilitate the identification and delineation of
depressional features, such as sinkholes, detention basins, and prairie
potholes. The detailed topological and geometric properties of surface
depressions can be useful for terrain analysis and hydrological
modeling, including the size, volume, mean depth, maximum depth, lowest
elevation, spill elevation, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis
length, elongatedness.

## State of the Field

Currently, there are a few open-source Python packages that can perform depression filling on digital elevation data, such as [RichDEM](https://richdem.readthedocs.io/) and [whitebox](https://github.com/giswqs/whitebox-python), the Python frontend for [WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools). However, there are no Python packages offering tools for delineating the nested hierarchy of surface depressions and catchments as well as simulating inundation dynamics. The **lidar** Python package is intended for filling this gap.

## Key Features

-   Smoothing DEMs using mean, median, and Gaussian filters.
-   Extracting depressions from DEMs.
-   Filtering out small artifact depressions based on user-specified minimum depression size.
-   Generating refined DEMs with small depressions filled but larger depressions kept intact.
-   Delineating depression nested hierarchy using the level-set method.
-   Delineating mount nested hierarchy using the level-set method.
-   Computing topological and geometric properties of depressions, including size, volume, mean depth, maximum depth, lowest elevation,
    spill elevation, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, elongatedness, eccentricity, orientation, and area-bbox-ratio.
-   Exporting depression properties as a csv file.

## Installation

**lidar** supports a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows,
macOS, and Linux operating systems. Note that you will need to have
**Python 3.x** (&lt; 3.9) installed. Python 2.x is not supported.
**lidar** is available on both [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lidar) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lidar).
lidar has a [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) dependency, which can be challenging to install using pip on Windows.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to install lidar from the conda-forge channel.
If you encounter any errors, please check the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below.

### Install from PyPI

To install **lidar** from PyPI, run this command in your terminal:

```console
pip install lidar
```

### Install from conda-forage

If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
installed on your computer, you can create a fresh conda environment to install lidar:

```console
conda create -n geo python=3.11
conda activate geo
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge lidar
```

### Upgrade lidar

If you have installed lidar before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```console
pip install -U lidar
```

If you use conda, you can update lidar to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

```console
mamba update -c conda-forge lidar
```

To install the development version from GitHub directly using Git, run the following code:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/opengeos/lidar
```

### Dependencies

lidar's Python dependencies are listed in its [requirements.txt](https://github.com/opengeos/lidar/blob/master/requirements.txt) file. In
addition, lidar has a C library dependency: GDAL &gt;=1.11.2. How to
install GDAL in different operating systems will be explained below.
More information about GDAL can be found [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).

#### Linux

##### Debian-based Linux

The following commands can be used to install GDAL for Debian-based
Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint).

```console
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
```

If you encounter any compiling errors, try the following commands.

```console
sudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
pip install wheel
```

##### Pacman-based Linux

The following commands can be used to install GDAL for Pacman-based
Linux distributions (e.g., Arch Linux, Manjaro). You might need to use
**sudo** if you encounter permission errors.

```console
sudo pacman -S yaourt --noconfirm
yaourt -S gdal --noconfirm
yaourt -S python-gdal --noconfirm
```

#### macOS

For a Homebrew based Python environment, do the following.

```console
brew update
brew install gdal
```

Alternatively, you can install GDAL binaries from [kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete). You will
then need to add the installed location
`/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs` to your system path.

#### Windows

The instruction below assumes that you have installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Open
**Anaconda Prompt** and enter the following commands to create a conda
environment and install required packages

```console
conda create -n geo python=3.11
conda activate geo
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge lidar
```

When installing the **lidar** package, if you encounter an error
saying `Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required`, please follow the steps

### A real-world example

The images below show working examples of the level set method for
delineating nested depressions in the Cottonwood Lake Study Area (CLSA),
North Dakota. More test datasets (e.g., the Pipestem watershed in the
Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota) can be downloaded from
<http://gishub.org/2019-JAWRA-Data>

The following example was conducted on a 64-bit Linux machine with a
quad-core Intel i7-7700 CPU and 16 GB RAM. The average running time of
the algorithm for this DEM was 0.75 seconds.

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.7 and 3.8. Check <https://github.com/opengeos/lidar/actions> and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
